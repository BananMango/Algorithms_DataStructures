**Python** is a dynamically typed language, as there is no advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type. Built-in classes can be divided into mutable and immutable(A class is immutable if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instantiation that cannot subsequently be changed). Mutable classes are: list, set, dict; And immutable: bool, int, float, tuple, str.

* **Bool** class is used to manipulate logic values, and the only two instances of that class are expressed as the literals True and False (default constructor bool(), returns False)
* **Int** class is primary numeric type in Python. The integer constructor int() returns 0 by default. 
* **Float** class is second primary numeric type in Python and is the sole floating-point type. The float constructor returns 0.0 by default
Own practice of implementing data structures and basic algorithms
* **Stack**: implemented using Python list with space usage of O(n) and running time of all operations of O(1)
