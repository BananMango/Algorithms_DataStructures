# Algorithms_DataStructures
## **Python** is a dynamically typed language, as there is no advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type. Built-in classes can be divided into mutable and immutable(A class is immutable if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instantiation that cannot subsequently be changed). Mutable classes are: list, set, dict; And immutable: bool, int, float, tuple, str.
* **Bool** class is used to manipulate logic values, and the only two instances of that class are expressed as the literals True and False (default constructor bool(), returns False)
* **Int** and **Float** classes are primary numeric types in Python
Own practice of implementing data structures and basic algorithms
* **Stack**: implemented using Python list with space usage of O(n) and running time of all operations of O(1)
